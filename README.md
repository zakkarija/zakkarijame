# Zakkarija Micallef - Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my professional background, skills, and projects. I built this website as a project to learn React and modern web development.

## Technologies Used

This project was bootstrapped with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and uses the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework for server-rendered applications
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Strongly typed JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Vanta.js](https://www.vantajs.com) - 3D animated backgrounds
- [SVGL](https://svgl.app) - SVG icon library

## Deployment

The site is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which provides seamless integration with Next.js projects.
