        Hello! I&apos;m Zak Micallef, a software engineer with a strong background in building reliable and scalable systems. My interests span infrastructure, CI/CD, high availability, and distributed architectures. I hold a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Malta, where I also gained industry experience during my internship at CCBill. I went on to work full-time at PhoenixNAP, an IaaS provider, where I spent two years leading feature development and working with technologies such as Spring Boot, NoSQL databases, and Kubernetes. Currently, I&apos;m advancing my expertise through a Master&apos;s degree in Computer Science at the University of Amsterdam, while continuing to apply my skills as a part-time Java Engineer at PhoenixNAP.
