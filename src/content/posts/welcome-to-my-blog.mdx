# Welcome to The Zakkarija Times

After building my portfolio website, I realized I wanted a space to share more detailed thoughts about technology, development practices, and the lessons learned along the way. Welcome to my blog!

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will be a mix of:

- **Technical deep-dives** into projects I'm working on
- **Development insights** from my experience with modern web technologies  
- **Thoughts on design** and user experience
- **Industry observations** and trends I find interesting

## Built with Modern Tools

This blog is powered by:

- Next.js 15 with the App Router
- MDX for rich content authoring
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- A clean, newspaper-inspired design

## Why Blog?

Writing helps clarify thinking. By sharing my experiences building with technologies like React, TypeScript, and modern CSS, I hope to:

1. Document my learning journey
2. Help other developers facing similar challenges
3. Create a conversation around best practices

> "The best way to learn is to teach" - this blog is my attempt at both.

## What's Next

I'm planning posts on topics like:

- Building responsive animations with CSS and JavaScript
- Database design patterns with Drizzle ORM
- My experience working with the T3 Stack
- Performance optimization techniques

Stay tuned for more content, and feel free to reach out if you have topics you'd like me to explore!
